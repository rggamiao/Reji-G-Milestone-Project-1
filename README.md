## Description

This is a quiz game that sorts the user into a Hogwarts house based on the answers they give.


## Deployment

The web game is deployed at https://rggamiao.github.io/ 

The game is a quiz game which operates mostly through mouse clicks.

Currently there is no function for when users have a tie in houses (the same amount of answers in two or more houses)


## Game Logic



The user will go through a 10 question quiz to get sorted into one of Hogwart's Houses by the Sorting hat. Each answer is stored in the answers array.

### Post-MVP Plans

Adding music and sound effects to each question
